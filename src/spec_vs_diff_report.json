However, the diff is truncated at the anchor tag rendering, so it’s not fully verifiable that all external links open in a new tab with rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" in both locations, nor that no remaining \"#\" hrefs exist for those four icons in the rendered output.",

      "reason": "In SiteFooter.tsx the <a> tag is truncated at `target=\"_blank` so `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"` cannot be confirmed; ContactPage.tsx rendering of the social icons is also truncated so target/rel attributes can’t be verified from the provided diff summary.",
