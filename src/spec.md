# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace placeholder social links in the site “Connect” areas with the provided YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Telegram URLs.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the footer “Connect” social icon hrefs to the provided YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Telegram URLs.
- Update the Contact page “Follow Us” social icon hrefs to the same provided URLs.
- Ensure all four external links open in a new tab and include `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, and none of these four icons use `#`.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click the YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Telegram icons in the footer and on the Contact page to open the correct social profiles in a new tab.
